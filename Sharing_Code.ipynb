    "# 1. Get the ssh key and upload it to GitHub website. Command: cd ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n",
    "# 2. For authentication, command: ssh -T git@github.com\n",
    "# 3. To enter the directory which I want to upload to GitHub, command: cd \"Documents/Areej Academic Data/My Research/CCR and Simulation Learning/Learning Python/Learning Data/\".\n",
    "# 4. Create a new repository in GitHub online \"Practice_MolSSI.git\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. To create a remote connection for data travel, command: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Areej17-eng/Practice_MolSSI.git\n",
    "# Here you copied you local \"Learning Data\" directory contents to a new git \n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. To push the data to the GitHub repository, command: git push -u origin main\n",

    "# main : Indicates the branch in the remote repository where the changes should be pushed.\n",
    "# -u origin main: Sets origin/main as the upstream branch, so you can use git push without specifying origin main in future commands.\n",

    "# 7. Enter passphrase: you know what\n",

    "# using the command: git status \n",
    "# Add all the untracked files to git repository (this is different than GitHub repository) using git add . or git add file_name\n",
